Navigating to http://localhost:8080/ should bring up the homepage which redirects to /goals/all.

Database is titled 'task-manager'

Tables created are 'goals' and 'tasks'

Foreign key from task to goal works correctly - just having trouble passing the goal ID to it's tasks so it knows they're associated.
I understand this is probably done via the url but can't seem to get everything right.
